# EasyFont 

## Introduction

EasyFont is a tool built from CSS to replace the deprecated HTML `<font>` tag and other HTML text styling tags.

To use EasyFont, you must first download it.  After downloading, put it in your HTML code with something like this:

`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/easy-font.css">`.

## How to Use EasyFont

Once you have EasyFont in your HTML, you must tell it how to style the parts of the HTML file you want the way you want them to be.  To do this, you can use either classes or IDs or both.  Here are the things that all the different classes and IDs in EasyFont do:
