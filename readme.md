# EasyFont 

## Introduction

EasyFont is a tool built from CSS to replace the deprecated HTML `<font>` tag and other HTML text styling tags.

To use EasyFont, you must first download it.  After downloading, put it in your HTML code with something like this:

`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/easy-font.css">`.
